**Project description:** Méja, a seamless, beautiful and complete approach to modern restaurant management. With a digital waitering and live order system, customers can browse the menu, order, track their orders, and pay for their bill all from the comfort of their phones. Restaurant staff get live updates of new orders as they come in and get a notification of any customers who need assistance from a waiter. Méja is built to help restaurants unlock their maximum potential.

### Key Feature Higlights

* Live Ordering System - Customers can order straight from their own device and restaurant staff will be able to provide live updates of their order.
* AI Chatbot - Méja features an AI-powered chatbot to help customers get help with the menu without needing a waiter.
* QR Table Management - No longer a need for proprietary beacons - customers can quickly get started on our app by scanning a QR code.
* Online Reservations - Want to save your seat before arriving? Customers will also be able to make bookings online through our platform.
* User and Community Reviews - Customers will be able to view and leave reviews for the restaurant and individual menu items. This includes 3rd party APIs like Zomato.
